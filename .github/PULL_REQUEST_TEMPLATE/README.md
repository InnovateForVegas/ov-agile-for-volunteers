# Overview Pull Request Templates

Drop in to the Overview repository (.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE directory), tune as needed.
Note that these will not be used by GitHub without the template link scheme with url parameters
in the .github/pull_request_template.md file in the same repository.

*NOTE*: due to the way GitHub displays markdown templates, it is unnecessarily cumbersome to include
a commented copyright/license header in each template file.

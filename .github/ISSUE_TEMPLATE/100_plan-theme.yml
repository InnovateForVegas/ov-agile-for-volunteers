        A Theme is an over-arching description of a major phase of development of an Initiative,
        made up of Epics which combine to reach the desired level of functionality.

        One or more Epics will form the base for an Agile Iteration.

        We can describe a Theme directly as an **Objective** and **Key Results** (OKRs).

  - type: markdown
    id: plan_objective_title
    attributes:
      value: "## Theme Objective"
        
  - type: textarea
    id: objective
    attributes:
      label: Objective
      description: Goals we hope to accomplish with this broadly-defined initiative element
      placeholder: A brief overview of what we aim to accomplished with this initiative component

    attributes:
      label: Key Results
      description: A list of Key Results indicating success
      placeholder: |
        - A list of one or more measurable
        - and demonstrably-achieved results
        - Check off items in implementation(s)
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: markdown
    id: plan_linking_title
    attributes:
      value: "## Issue Linking"

  - type: markdown
    id: plan_linking_description
    attributes:
      value: |
        Link issues by url (see info for issue linking bottom of page) to indicate
        graph relationship between them, with tags in a list indicating the link relationship.

        Tags and Linked Issues
        - :epic --> an Epic in this Agile hierarchy
        - :merge-to --> a Theme that is a merging of this and other Theme(s)
        - :merge-from <-- a Theme that was merged into this Theme
        - :split-to --> a Theme that is one of multiple Themes derived from this Theme
        - :split-from <-- a Theme that was split into this and other Themes
        - :spike-to --> a virtual Theme for planning and estimation of related Themes
        - :spike-from <-- a real Theme connected to a virtual spike Theme

        Merge-to and Split-to Theme issue(s) should be **Closed as Not Planned** in favor of the
        consolidated or expanded Theme issue(s), as appropriate.
        
        Do not delete, mark as merge or split and **Closed as Not Planned**.

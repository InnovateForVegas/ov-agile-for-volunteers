# Blue Sky - Agile for Volunteers - Documentation

Documentation for this collection of principles and methods will need to address the needs of anyone interested in participating in a volunteer initiative, or as part of a volunteer cohort, which has adopted these.

A full spectrum of consumers of Agile for Volunteers documentation will likely range from experienced program management and project maintainer personalities, to absolute beginners willing and wanting to learn, and non of these are necessarily *coders*.

While this is a meta initiative itself, using Agile for Volunteers principles and methods as we implement and document the tools, processes, and methodologies based on our fundamental principles, it is important to keep in mind that as we follow this path with User Stories paving the way for our planning efforts, making note of this spectrum of users will be essential. It is entirely possible that the variation of User Types for User Stories will be the largest overall collection, the broadest spectrum, as might be encountered in an Agile for Volunteers initiative.

## Publication

As with the base expectation of an Agile for Volunteer Initiative, its Component Projects are most likely captured and maintained as revision controlled repositories, making use of git and GitHub as examples (there are variations on this theme, more possibilities will and should become apparent over time and with adoption and deployment).

Creating source documentation for in-process authoring and consumption is a bare minimum, but source materials authored using Markdown (as this document is) and stored in a repo directory structure is not necessarily any-user-friendly. In fact, quite the opposite.

There are many options and methods for converting source documents (authored in Markdown, ReStructured Text, and other formats) into a navigable website with more commonly-expected navigation, headings, flow, and so on. External and well-known services such as ReadTheDocs and GitBook are potential candidates, but there are many options here and so this is the bluest of Blue Sky notions to begin with.

## Internationalization and Localization

If Documentation source materials are authored with these mind, it should be merely a substantial task to localize these to accommodate consumers speaking something other than the language of origin, which is most likely American English (the language in which this document was originally authored).

This need will extend beyond the Documentation for this Initiative, into the tools and any documentation content that exists for those (which may become part of the overall Documentation, or which may be useful to speakers of other languages for specific collaboration at the Component Project level, or both).

If we presume web-based access to Documentation, there are always more and more capable methods for automated language translation. There may be some particular need to curate a formally translated collection of Documentation parts. Needless to say, those who are fluent enough in more than one language who would contribute to a manual curation effort are contributors to the initiative, and this is a part of the overall workflow by design.
